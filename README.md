# Exploratory Data Analysis in Finance Project

---
by Barney Rolph

Welcome to my project designed to develop my skills as a Data Analysist.  My code aims to access a financial database through AWS allowing me to explore useful analysis in this setting.

### Installation
- Clone the repository
- Obtain the credentials for access to the RDS server and save them as 'credentials.yaml' file in the same directory as the code.
- Make a copy of the environment using the included yaml file.


### Usage
- Use the class, methods and functions in db_utils.py to access the data.

### File structure
- All the files are in the main directory at the moment (this is also where the credentials.yaml should go.)
